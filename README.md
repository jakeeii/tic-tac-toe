# tic-tac-

Simple tic-tac-toe game. The game is designed to be played with two humans but
the ability to play against an AI will be added later. I tried to limit all the
relevant functions within a gameboard module and IIFE, only returning the three
necessary functions to play the game to prevent the others from being accessed.
The game can be played as many times as one would like as there is a "Restart"
button right at the bottom of the page.
